Regular Expressions with Iterators Lab / Homework

- For this exercise we will be working with this array:
["Cat", "Dog", "Polar Bear", "Grizzly Bear", "Antelope", "Kangaroo", "Bear"]

- Using .filter()

    - Return an array with only animals that have three-letter names.
    - Return an array with only animals that have two-word names.
    - Return an array with only animals that don't start with the letter K.

- Using .map()

    - Return an array that changes all animal names containing "bear" to "Teddy Bear".
    - Write a regular expression that checks if the animal is either cat or dog. If it is cat, replace the value with "Kitty Cat" and if it is a dog replace the value with "Puppy".

- Bonus: Use constructors and prototypes to set this functionality up in an object-oriented way.
